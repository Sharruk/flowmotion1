You are a senior frontend engineer improving an existing login page UI.

TASK:
Fix the “Terms and Conditions” interaction to behave like a professional production application.

CURRENT PROBLEMS:
- Clicking “Terms and Conditions” does not open a proper dialog
- The checkbox is visually misaligned (appears above text instead of left)
- Users can tick the checkbox without reading the terms
- There is no enforced scroll-to-accept behavior

REQUIRED CHANGES (MANDATORY):

1) Checkbox Placement
- Place the checkbox to the LEFT of the text:
  “I agree to the Terms and Conditions”
- Align it horizontally like standard signup forms
- Clicking the label text should toggle the checkbox

2) Modal Dialog for Terms
- Clicking “Terms and Conditions” must open a SMALL centered modal dialog
- The background page must be dimmed (overlay)
- The modal must NOT be full-screen
- Include a close (✕) icon at the top-right

3) Scroll-to-Accept Enforcement
- The modal must contain scrollable Terms content
- The “Accept & Continue” button must be DISABLED initially
- Enable the button ONLY after the user scrolls to the bottom
- This must be enforced via JavaScript (not visual only)

4) Acceptance Logic
- Clicking “Accept & Continue” should:
  - Close the modal
  - Automatically check the “I agree” checkbox
- Closing the modal without accepting must NOT check the box

5) Login Button Protection
- Disable the Login button until:
  - Username is filled
  - Password is filled
  - Terms checkbox is checked
- Show a subtle inline validation message if Login is clicked without acceptance

6) UI/UX Constraints
- Do NOT change existing layout, colors, or fonts
- Use only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
- Keep the solution simple, readable, and academic-project appropriate

REFERENCE BEHAVIOR:
Match the UX pattern of standard signup forms where:
- Terms open in a modal
- User must scroll and explicitly accept
- Checkbox cannot be bypassed

FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Modify existing files only (do not rewrite the whole page)
- Ensure clean, working interaction
- No console errors
- No external libraries

Implement this fully and correctly.
