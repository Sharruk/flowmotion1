You are a Software Engineering documentation assistant.

I have built a working academic prototype called **FlowMotion**, a habit and routine management system, using the existing codebase in this Replit workspace.

My institution is:
Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering (SSN), Kalavakkam  
Course: ICS1405 – Software Engineering Principles and Practices  
Regulation: 2023  
Batch: 2024–2029  
Academic Year: 2026–2027 (Even Semester)

I need you to generate **formal lab documentation in DOCX (.docx) format** for the following experiments, strictly following Software Engineering principles and academic evaluation standards.

⚠️ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use my existing project **FlowMotion** as the base system.
2. Treat this as a **student prototype**, not a production app.
3. Align explanations with **2nd-year Software Engineering level**.
4. Clearly label all sections with headings.
5. Write in clear, professional, exam-friendly language.
6. Wherever applicable, relate explanations to the actual features visible in the code and UI.
7. Include tables, diagrams (described textually), and justifications.
8. Output must be a **single DOCX file**, well formatted.

   - Time constraints
   - Platform constraints (Linux-based development)
6. Assumptions & Dependencies
7. Traceability (simple mapping explanation)
8. SRS Conclusion

----------------------------------------------------------------
EXPERIMENT 3: Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Include:

1. Introduction to DFD
2. Level-0 DFD
   - External entities
   - Main process
   - Data stores
   - Data flow explanation
3. Level-1 DFD
   - Decomposition of main process
   - Sub-process explanations
4. Level-2 DFD (selected module)
   - Detailed breakdown
5. DFD Validation & Balancing
6. Simplification & Optimization Analysis
7. Observations & Justification
8. Conclusion

----------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Maintain consistency across all experiments
- Clearly state this is a **prototype implementation**
- Mention future scope where features are not fully implemented
- Use diagrams as textual descriptions suitable for lab records
- Generate the final output as a **single DOCX file**
