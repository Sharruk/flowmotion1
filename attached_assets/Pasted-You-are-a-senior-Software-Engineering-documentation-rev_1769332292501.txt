You are a senior Software Engineering documentation reviewer and academic evaluator.

I am providing you with an existing lab documentation draft for a project called **FlowMotion: Intelligent Habit & Routine Management**, developed as part of:
ICS1405 – Software Engineering Principles and Practices
Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering (SSN)

Your task is to **IMPROVE and ENRICH the existing documentation** so that it meets **O-Grade (Outstanding)** evaluation standards.

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. DO NOT change the project scope or claims unrealistically.
2. Treat this as a **2nd-year academic prototype**, not a production system.
3. Retain all existing content, but:
   - Expand it analytically
   - Add justification, inference, and traceability
4. Improve depth, not verbosity.
5. Write like a **top-performing student**, not like marketing content.
6. Maintain professional academic tone suitable for SSN lab evaluation.
7. Output must be a **polished DOCX-ready document**.

-----------------------------------------
SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED
-----------------------------------------

EXPERIMENT 1:
- Expand Problem Identification with real-world comparison and reasoning.
- Add a Stakeholder Analysis table (Users, Developers, Evaluators).
- Add a Functional Requirement → Module → Implementation mapping table.
- Justify architectural and technology choices using software engineering principles.
- Add a short Testing & Observation table with outcomes and inferences.

EXPERIMENT 2 (SRS):
- Expand Functional Requirements with priority (High/Medium/Low).
- Add Assumptions and Dependencies section.
- Improve Non-Functional Requirements by explaining their impact on design.
- Clearly state constraints and how they influence architecture decisions.

EXPERIMENT 3 (DFD):
- Add modeling assumptions.
- Explain DFD balancing between Level-0 and Level-1.
- Justify why certain processes were decomposed to Level-2.
- Add a short optimization and simplification analysis.

CONCLUSION:
- Add engineering inferences.
- Mention trade-offs, limitations, and learning outcomes.
- Clearly state how software engineering principles were applied and validated.

-----------------------------------------
FINAL GOAL:
-----------------------------------------
The final document should clearly demonstrate:
- Strong analytical thinking
- Requirement traceability
- Engineering justification
- Design reasoning
- Academic maturity

This document should be competitive enough to score **O-grade** in an SSN Software Engineering lab evaluation.
