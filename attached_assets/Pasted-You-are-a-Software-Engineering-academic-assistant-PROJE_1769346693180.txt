You are a Software Engineering academic assistant.

PROJECT:
FlowMotion – Intelligent Habit & Routine Management System (Linux Desktop Application)

COURSE:
ICS1405 – Software Engineering Principles and Practices

TASK:
Generate COMPLETE documentation content for **EXPERIMENT 3: Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Modeling**
based on the FINAL version of the FlowMotion system.

IMPORTANT:
- This is an academic lab record
- Use formal university-style language
- Follow Anna University / SSN lab record format
- DO NOT write code
- DO NOT assume mobile app (Linux desktop only)
- Output must be text-based descriptions of diagrams (I will redraw later)

--------------------------------------------------
STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW (STRICT)
--------------------------------------------------

Title Page Content:
- Experiment Number: EXPERIMENT – 3
- Experiment Name: Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Modeling
- Project Name: FlowMotion – Intelligent Habit & Routine Management System

-----------------------------------
1. AIM
-----------------------------------
Write a clear academic aim explaining why DFDs are used for FlowMotion.

-----------------------------------
2. SCENARIO
-----------------------------------
Explain the purpose of modeling data flow for a Linux-based habit tracking system
with AI feedback and OS-level notifications.

-----------------------------------
3. TOOLS USED
-----------------------------------
Mention:
- draw.io (for diagram creation)
- Django (system reference)
- SQLite (data store reference)

-----------------------------------
4. DFD CREATION, DECOMPOSITION & ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------

4.1 LEVEL‑0 DFD (CONTEXT DIAGRAM)

Include:
- Description of Level‑0 DFD
- External Entities:
  • User
  • Linux Desktop Notification System
  • Gemini AI Service
- Single Process:
  • P0 – FlowMotion System
- Data Flows:
  • Habit data input
  • Completion status
  • Notification messages
  • Emotional feedback

-----------------------------------
4.2 LEVEL‑1 DFD (DECOMPOSITION OF P0)

Decompose P0 into the following processes:

Processes:
- P1 – User Authentication & Profile Management
- P2 – Habit Creation & Management
- P3 – Scheduling & Notification Engine
- P4 – AI Feedback Generation
- P5 – Analytics & History Management

Data Stores:
- D1 – User Database
- D2 – Habit Database
- D3 – Habit Response History

Include:
- Description
- Process interaction explanation
- Balancing statement with Level‑0 DFD

-----------------------------------
4.3 LEVEL‑2 DFD (DECOMPOSITION OF ONE PROCESS)

Decompose ONLY:
- P3 – Scheduling & Notification Engine

Sub‑Processes:
- P3.1 – Monitor Habit Schedule
- P3.2 – Trigger Pre‑Reminder Notification
- P3.3 – Trigger Main Reminder
- P3.4 – Record User Response

Explain:
- Why only one process is decomposed
- How data flows between sub‑processes

-----------------------------------
5. DEMO / FLOW EXPLANATION
-----------------------------------

Provide a step‑by‑step explanation:
1. User logs in
2. Habit is created
3. Scheduler monitors time
4. Linux notification is triggered
5. User responds
6. AI generates emotional feedback
7. Data is stored and analytics updated

-----------------------------------
6. DATA FLOW VALIDATION
-----------------------------------

Mention:
- No direct access from external entities to data stores
- Every process has input and output
- DFD balancing is maintained

-----------------------------------
7. SIMPLIFICATION, OPTIMIZATION & JUSTIFICATION
-----------------------------------

Explain:
- Why deep decomposition was avoided
- Why rule-based logic was grouped
- How clarity and maintainability improved

-----------------------------------
8. DOCUMENTATION & OBSERVATIONS
-----------------------------------

Include:
- Diagrams recorded
- Assumptions made
- Validation observations

-----------------------------------
9. RESULT / CONCLUSION
-----------------------------------

Conclude that:
- Level‑0, Level‑1, and Level‑2 DFDs were successfully modeled
- Data flow correctness and system clarity were achieved
- The system design is maintainable and scalable

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT RULES
--------------------------------------------------
- Output ONLY documentation text
- Use headings and subheadings
- No bullet overload
- No marketing language
- Write like a lab record that fills multiple pages
