You are an academic Software Engineering reviewer refining a finalized project document for top-grade evaluation.

TASK:
Carefully revise the given “FlowMotion” documentation with MINIMAL, TARGETED improvements.

DO NOT rewrite the entire document.
DO NOT change the project scope.
DO NOT introduce new features beyond what is already stated.

Your goal is to:
- Remove technical overstatements
- Improve academic completeness
- Strengthen evaluator-facing sections
- Add a mature Future Scope section

--------------------------------------------------
PART A: TECHNICAL WORDING CORRECTION (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------------------------

Identify and correct any technically inaccurate or over-claiming language.

Specifically:
- Replace phrases such as:
  “integrating into the OS kernel”

With accurate, evaluator-safe wording like:
- “Linux desktop notification subsystem”
- “OS-level user-space notification services”

Make NO other semantic changes in these sentences.

--------------------------------------------------
PART B: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS COMPLETENESS
--------------------------------------------------

In the Non-Functional Requirements section:
- Retain all existing items
- ADD the following missing aspects with 1–2 concise lines each:

1) Security  
   Example framing:
   “Security: User data is isolated per account using Django’s authentication framework, session middleware, and access-controlled views.”

2) Scalability  
   Example framing:
   “Scalability: While optimized for single-user local execution, the architecture supports future migration to multi-user environments.”

Do NOT imply cloud deployment or production scale.

--------------------------------------------------
PART C: ARCHITECTURE SECTION ACADEMIC SIGNALING
--------------------------------------------------

In the System Architecture section:
- Add a brief reference such as:
  “As illustrated in the system architecture diagram…”

This is a textual reference only.
Do NOT add or describe a diagram image.

--------------------------------------------------
PART D: AI SECTION ACADEMIC STRENGTHENING
--------------------------------------------------

Enhance the AI-related subsection to reflect responsible engineering.

Without adding new features, briefly emphasize:
- Output length constraints
- Deterministic prompt structure
- Basic hallucination control via constrained prompts

Avoid buzzwords.
Maintain an academic, cautious tone.

--------------------------------------------------
PART E: RESULTS / OBSERVATIONS ENRICHMENT
--------------------------------------------------

Slightly expand the Results / Testing / Validation section by adding:
- Qualitative observations such as:
  - Improved habit consistency
  - Reduced missed reminders
  - Positive engagement with emotional feedback

Do NOT add numerical claims or fabricated metrics.

--------------------------------------------------
PART F: CONCLUSION ACADEMIC CLOSURE
--------------------------------------------------

Strengthen the Conclusion by:
- Reconnecting outcomes to Software Engineering principles
- Emphasizing learning outcomes
- Ending with an academic reflection (not a promotional tone)

Limit to one short additional paragraph.

--------------------------------------------------
PART G: ADD FUTURE SCOPE SECTION
--------------------------------------------------

ADD a new section titled:

“FUTURE SCOPE AND EXTENSIONS”

Placement:
- Insert AFTER the Conclusion

Content Guidelines:
Write 4–6 concise, well-structured points covering:

1) Mobile Platform Expansion  
   - Clearly state the current system is Linux-desktop–first  
   - Mention future Android/iOS clients using shared backend APIs  

2) Cross-Device Synchronization  
   - Optional cloud-based sync  
   - Privacy-first design emphasis  

3) Advanced AI Personalization  
   - Emotion-adaptive feedback  
   - Habit difficulty auto-adjustment  

4) System-Level Enhancements  
   - Deeper GNOME/KDE integration  
   - Tray-based widget or background service  

5) Scalability & Deployment  
   - Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL  
   - Optional Docker-based deployment  

Style Requirements:
- Academic tone
- Confident but realistic
- Use phrasing such as:
  “can be extended to…”
  “future versions may incorporate…”
  “the architecture allows…”

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT RULES
--------------------------------------------------

- Preserve all existing strengths
- Modify only the specified areas
- Do NOT output explanations
- Output the revised document content only
