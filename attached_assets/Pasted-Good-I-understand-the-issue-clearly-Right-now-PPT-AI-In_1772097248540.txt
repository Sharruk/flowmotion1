Good. I understand the issue clearly.

Right now:

✔ PPT → AI Insights working
❌ Documentation → no AI
❌ Gym → no AI
❌ Workout → no AI
❌ Breathing → no AI

That means your system is probably:

Hardcoded for “presentation” category
OR

Keyword detection only checking “ppt”
OR

Gemini only triggered for one category

We will fix this properly.

You said:
👉 “Give me step-by-step prompts so I can copy to Replit.”

Perfect. Use these one by one.

✅ STEP 1 — REMOVE HARDCODED CATEGORY FILTER

Copy this first:

Step 1:
Search entire project for:

- "presentation"
- "ppt"
- "if category == Presentation"
- any hardcoded AI tool logic

Remove any condition that limits AI recommendations
to only Presentation category.

AI recommendation should run for ALL habits,
not just one category.

Wait for it to update.

✅ STEP 2 — REMOVE KEYWORD LIMITATION

Right now you probably have something like:

if "ppt" in task → call Gemini

We fix that.

Copy this:

Step 2:
Modify AI trigger logic.

Instead of checking only specific keywords like:
ppt, presentation

Change logic to:

Call Gemini for EVERY new habit created,
regardless of category.

Do not restrict by keyword.

AI should dynamically decide which tools are relevant.
✅ STEP 3 — IMPROVE GEMINI PROMPT (CRITICAL)

Right now your prompt is probably biased toward presentation tools.

Replace it with this:

Step 3:
Update Gemini prompt to be fully dynamic.

New prompt:

"You are an intelligent assistant.
Based on the user's task, recommend 3-5 relevant AI tools 
that can help complete that task.

Examples:
- If task is workout → suggest fitness apps
- If task is documentation → suggest writing AI tools
- If task is coding → suggest coding assistants
- If task is meditation → suggest mindfulness apps

Return response ONLY in JSON format:

[
  {
    "name": "Tool Name",
    "description": "Short description",
    "url": "Official website"
  }
]

Do not assume presentation.
Adapt recommendation based on task."
✅ STEP 4 — CHECK IF AI FUNCTION IS ACTUALLY CALLED

Maybe Gemini is not even being triggered.

Copy this:

Step 4:
Add debug logging inside AI recommendation function.

Log:
- task name
- category
- whether Gemini API is called
- Gemini response

Verify that AI function runs
when creating gym, workout, documentation habits.

If Gemini is not called → that’s your bug.

✅ STEP 5 — REMOVE CATEGORY-BASED FILTER IN TEMPLATE

Sometimes backend sends data, but template hides it.

Copy this:

Step 5:
Check habit detail template.

Remove any condition like:

{% if habit.category == "Presentation" %}

AI Insights section should display
whenever AIRecommendation objects exist.

Do not restrict by category.
✅ STEP 6 — AUTO-GENERATE AI FOR OLD HABITS

Currently AI may only run when habit is first created.

To enable for old habits:

Step 6:
Create a management command or script
that loops through all existing habits.

If habit has no AIRecommendation,
call Gemini and generate recommendations.

Run this once to populate AI for gym,
documentation, breathing, etc.
✅ STEP 7 — ADD FALLBACK LOGIC (VERY IMPORTANT)

Sometimes Gemini may return nothing for things like:

breathing

stretching

walking

Add fallback:

Step 7:
If Gemini returns empty result,
fallback to generic tool suggestions
based on category.

Example:
- Fitness → MyFitnessPal, Nike Training Club
- Writing → Notion AI, Grammarly
- Meditation → Headspace, Calm

This guarantees something always appears.
