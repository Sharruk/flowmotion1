FlowMotion is a Django-based full-stack web application running locally on Ubuntu Linux at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000


This project does NOT use browser notifications.

All reminders must be sent using Linux system notifications via:

notify-send


The website itself does NOT push notifications.
Instead, Django runs a background scheduler that checks time and tells Linux to show notifications.

🧠 CORE IDEA (IMPORTANT)
Habit Schedule (Database)
        ↓
Background Time Checker (APScheduler)
        ↓
Linux Desktop Notification (notify-send)

🛠 TECHNOLOGY (FIXED – DO NOT CHANGE)
Purpose	Tool
Backend	Django
Scheduler	APScheduler
Notifications	notify-send
Click action	notify-send --action
OS	Ubuntu Linux

❌ No browser notifications
❌ No Firebase
❌ No Celery
❌ No mobile notifications

✔ Pure Linux desktop notifications (college-level project)

🎯 MAIN GOAL

Implement a PER-HABIT Linux notification system that works automatically in the background.

Each habit must send its own notifications independently.

🔔 NOTIFICATION FLOW (PER HABIT)
Example Habit

Habit: Exercise

Time: 4:00 PM

Frequency: Daily

Timeline
Time	Notification
3:50 PM	Upcoming reminder
4:00 PM	Main reminder (clickable)
4:10 PM	Missed reminder
Every 10 min	Repeat until completed
When completed	Stop notifications
🔔 NOTIFICATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Pre-Reminder (10 minutes before)

Send:

⏰ Exercise starts in 10 minutes

2️⃣ Main Reminder (Clickable)

At exact reminder time:

▶ Time for Exercise – Click to start


When clicked, it must open:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/habits/<habit_id>/


Use:

notify-send --action

3️⃣ Missed Reminder

If habit is NOT completed:

❌ You missed Exercise. Start now?


Repeat every 10 minutes until:

Habit is marked completed

OR the day ends

🗓 FREQUENCY SUPPORT

Notification logic must respect habit frequency:

Daily → Every day

Weekly → Only selected weekday

Custom → Only selected dates

Skip notifications on invalid days.

🧠 IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
Scheduler

Use APScheduler

Run a background job every 1 minute

Check all habits

Decide which notification to send

Notification Logic

Use subprocess to call notify-send

No browser-based notifications

All logic runs server-side

Backend File Structure

Create:

habits/notification_service.py


This file must:

Calculate current time vs habit time

Send correct notification (pre / main / missed)

Stop notifications once habit is completed
