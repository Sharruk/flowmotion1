You are fixing a broken modal implementation on a login page.

CRITICAL BUG:
The “Terms and Conditions” content is rendering inline at the bottom of the page instead of appearing as a modal dialog overlay.

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
Fix it properly.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT IGNORE):

1) True Modal Behavior
- The Terms and Conditions must appear in a CENTERED MODAL DIALOG
- The modal must use:
  position: fixed
  top: 50%
  left: 50%
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
  z-index higher than the page
- The modal must NOT push page content down
- The modal must float above the page

2) Background Overlay
- Add a semi-transparent dark overlay behind the modal
- Overlay must cover the entire viewport
- Background page scrolling must be DISABLED while modal is open
- Clicking outside the modal must NOT close it

3) Scrollable Modal Content
- Modal body must have a fixed height
- Terms text must be scrollable INSIDE the modal only
- Page behind must remain static

4) Scroll-to-Accept Enforcement
- “Accept & Continue” button must be DISABLED initially
- Enable the button ONLY when the user scrolls to the bottom of the modal content
- This must be enforced via JavaScript scroll detection

5) Acceptance Logic
- Clicking “Accept & Continue” must:
  - Close the modal
  - Automatically check the “I agree to the Terms and Conditions” checkbox
- Closing the modal via ✕ must NOT check the checkbox

6) Checkbox Layout
- Checkbox must be LEFT of the text
- Text click toggles checkbox
- Must match standard signup UX (like professional sites)

7) Login Button Guard
- Login button must remain disabled unless:
  - Username filled
  - Password filled
  - Terms checkbox checked
- Show subtle inline validation if attempted without acceptance

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT render Terms inline in the page
- Do NOT use full-page layouts
- Do NOT use external libraries
- Use only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS
- Modify existing files only
- Ensure no layout regression elsewhere

GOAL:
The Terms must behave like a real modal dialog,
not like a section appended to the page.

Fix this completely and correctly.
